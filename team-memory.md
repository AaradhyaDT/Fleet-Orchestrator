# Memory Log

Append-only. Add new entries at the bottom, oldest first — keeps `git diff`
readable and avoids merge conflicts across profiles' auto-sync commits.

Format:

```## YYYY-MM-DD
- One line per fact/decision/thing worth remembering across accounts.
```

Distributed via `sync.ps1`: new entries from `orchestrator-state/memory/`
are automatically appended under date headers during sync (via
`Sync-MemoryToTeamMemory`), and hand-written entries can also be added directly.
`read_team_memory` provides chat-callable querying across all entries.

- [Aaradhya, 2026-08-05T09:12:54Z] Gateway side of WIRE_FORMAT_v1.md is implemented (task_2026-08-05_006, done): parse_event() in gateway/receiver/wire_format.py now real — JSON decode, required-field + peak_features channel validation, unrecognized fields to .extra, raw_window always None (v1 excludes it). EventPayload.timestamp renamed timestamp_ms (int, matches spec). Heads up for merge_results: my checkpoint's commit_sha (c856975) is local to my sandbox clone, not yet on origin — I don't have push access, delivered as a zip for the human owner to extract + push via sync.ps1. Will resubmit checkpoint with the real origin sha once that lands. If merge_results runs before then it won't find c856975 on origin/gateway-skeleton — hold off or expect a miss.
- [orchestrator, 2026-08-05T08:29:53Z] task_2026-08-05_001 (LSTMs_for_Text_Classification.ipynb TODOs) completed outside orchestrator-mcp's git-merge path: notebook has no home in Claude-Desktop repo, so subtasks 002/003 were done and delivered directly to user rather than checkpointed+merged (code checkpoints require branch_name+commit_sha, which don't apply to a non-repo file). Tasks released back to pending rather than falsely marked done/merged.

## 2026-08-06

- [orchestrator, 2026-08-06T14:59:26Z] LSTM task tree (001/002/003) PAUSED per user instruction, 2026-08-06. Do not claim 002/003 until resumed. Only SPARK work (004/005/006 tree, and any new SPARK tasks) is active. user3's untracked NotebookLM cleanup (deleted placeholder be70f5bc..., cleaned duplicate sources on notebook 2c00f5a4...) remains unfiled — no task_id, no checkpoint — still pending a decision on whether to create_task it.

## 2026-08-10

- [Rupesh, 2026-08-10T14:31:09Z] task_2026-08-10_002 (chapter3 UCI MHEALTH regression) confirmed landed on origin/main as aa93f28 "mid-edits sync2" (AaradhyaDT, direct push) — identical wording to my local checkpoint commit 3e8c897, which is now superseded/redundant and should NOT be merged. If merge_results runs against this task, skip it — content is already on main via a different sha. Full repo-wide stale-term sweep (Telegram/Streamlit/MQTT/Postgres/RPi/UCI MHEALTH/100Hz) on current origin/main is clean. Proposal side of SPARK is fully synced to tracker v37 locked design as of aa93f28.

## 2026-08-10

- [claude-audit, 2026-08-10T14:36:34Z] **SPARK repo audit complete — 2026-08-10 14:45 UTC**

✓ Commit aa93f28 (mid-edits sync2) confirmed live on origin/main
✓ Chapter 3 dataset fix verified: SisFall/self-collected wording correct
✓ LaTeX integrity: all braces balanced, 14 citations valid
✓ Stale terminology sweep clean: only legitimate negations remain (no RPi/MQTT/UCI MHEALTH in body except literature contrasts)

**Issue found & fixed:** Abbreviations list contained stale MQTT and RPi entries (not in locked design). Removed. Corrected abbreviations.tex in outputs ready to merge.

**Next:** Aaradhya pulls abbreviations.tex, recompiles thesis_report.pdf, commits & pushes.

All outstanding editorial work resolved. Repo clean for March 2027 milestone.

- [claude_chat, 2026-08-11T10:27:27Z] **EX751 Study Session — 16:00 UTC start (task_2026-08-11_005)**

Protocol: All answers now cite source (NLM notebook c627a211-552e-496b-9ebb-42d22ac05a95) + push to team memory.

**Q2 Solved — Frequency Reuse Ratio Derivation + Optimal N**

- 4e1fc953, 92d133b9, e623b244 (Lecture notes, Suramya Sharma Dahal, Tribhuvan Univ)

Answer: **Q = √3N** derived via Law of Cosines (120° angle, hexagonal grid). **Optimal N=7** for 15 dB S/I, 400 duplex channels → **57 channels/cell**.

Next: Ch2 GoS/Erlang (Q1, Q6) block 17:15–18:05. On track, 2h elapsed.

- [claude_chat, 2026-08-11T10:29:25Z] **CORRECTION: Q2 Source Attribution**

Earlier listed source 0a509b56 as Q2 source — **INCORRECT**.

Actual Q2 sources (NLM notebook c627a211-552e-496b-9ebb-42d22ac05a95):

- [claude_chat, 2026-08-11T10:35:41Z] **Q2 Derivation Deep-Dive: √(3N) = D**

Sources (same as Q2): 92d133b9, 4e1fc953, e623b244

**Law of Cosines Application:**

- d_adj = √3R (adjacent cell center distance)
- Path to co-channel cell: move i cells (distance i√3R), rotate 60°, move j cells (distance j√3R)
- **Critical: Interior angle = 120°** (because 180° − 60° = 120°)
- D² = (i√3R)² + (j√3R)² − 2(i√3R)(j√3R)cos(120°)
- cos(120°) = −0.5, so: D² = 3R²(i² + ij + j²) = 3R²N
- **D = R√(3N)**, thus **Q = √(3N)**

For N=7 (typical), Q ≈ 4.58

## 2026-08-11

- [claude_chat, 2026-08-11T10:42:53Z] **Q2 FULL COMBINED ANSWER (derivation + numerical) — delivered to user**

Sources: 92d133b9, 4e1fc953, e623b244 (Ch1&2 notes) + 4fec49d0 (Sample Q pool)

Part 1: Q=√3N via Law of Cosines, 120° angle, D²=3R²(i²+ij+j²)=3R²N → D=R√3N → Q=D/R=√3N

Part 2: 20MHz/25kHz duplex → S=400 channels. S/I=15dB→31.62 ratio. 31.62=1.5N² → N=4.59 → round up to valid N=7 (i²+ij+j² set: 1,3,4,7,9,12). k=400/7≈57 channels/cell.

Full combined answer given to user — complete, no further action needed on Q2.

Sources: 76615938 (Sample Q, R=1.6km version) + 92d133b9/e623b244 (capacity formula C=Nk)

⚠ FLAG: sources 0a509b56 & f8ea1917 give R=1.5km (variant), differs from 76615938's R=1.6km. Solved using 1.6km per HTML plan.

32 cells, R=1.6km, N=7, S=336 channels →
Area/cell = 2.5981×R² = 6.651 km² → Total area = 212.83 km²
k = 336/7 = 48 channels/cell
C = 32×48 = 1536 simultaneous calls (verified via M=32/7=4.57, C=4.57×336=1536)

- [claude_chat, 2026-08-11T11:34:31Z] **Q1 Solved — Handoff Prioritization + GoS Definitions**

Sources: 76615938 (Sample Q), 92d133b9/e623b244 (Ch1&2 notes), 71150add (Trunking/GoS notes)

Definitions: GoS (block/delay probability), Traffic Intensity (A=λH, Erlangs), Holding Time H, Blocked Call (lost call, congestion).

Two handoff schemes: (1) Guard channels — reserved fraction for handoff only, reduces drops but raises new-call blocking. (2) Channel borrowing — dynamic on-demand allocation, reduces both blocking & forced termination. (Bonus: queuing during dwell-time.)

Working through HTML block order: Block0(Q2,Q7)✓ Block1(Q1,Q6)✓Q1 done,Q6 next. Then Block2(Q11,Q8,Q9/Q12), Block3(Q3,Q4,Q8), Block4(Q5), Block5(Q13,interleaving), Block6(equalizer Q10/Q14), Block7(Q15,Q18,Q16).

- [user_2, 2026-08-13T06:24:39Z] KEC Makerspace Ambassador bio — Aaradhya Dev Tamrakar, finalized draft for team.html:

Aaradhya is a fourth-year BEI student and our Ambassador on the Web/IT track. Between IEEE (he's Vice Chair of the KEC KTM branch) and the Fusemachines AI Fellowship, he builds — his portfolio, embedded projects, the odd broken workflow he decides needs fixing. His own site proves the habit: multi-page, custom-styled, with a contact form he rebuilt three layers deep so it never silently fails. Fun facts: his minor project was a gesture-controlled self-balancing robot. The rest of him runs on the same make-do streak: 7 years of guitar and 20 instruments, all self-taught by ear; workouts with no gym, no equipment; and a refusal to pay for a single AI tool — free tier, pushed as far as it legally goes.

Skills: Embedded systems (ESP32, Arduino), TinyML/edge AI (TFLite Micro), Android dev (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose), Python/ML, PCB & robotics projects, GitHub Pages web development, 3D printing/design, laser cutting.

## 2026-08-15

- [claude_chat, 2026-08-15T04:36:10Z] **Skill update — assume-reader-intelligence (writing style)**

Added `references/project-reports.md` variant for SPARK/BiasAperture/thesis/IOE report writing. SKILL.md frontmatter now also triggers on report/thesis writing requests, pointing to the reference file.

Report-mode overrides vs base skill:

1. Cut term definitions harder — examiners (Dipen Manandhar/SPARK, Shreejan Kisee/BiasAperture) are domain experts, don't define CNN/TFLite/IMU/SHAP/fairness metrics/EU AI Act/NIST AI RMF etc. Only define project-specific coined terms.
2. Do NOT cut methodology/design-choice justification for density (base skill's "let reader infer" rule doesn't apply here) — reasoning is the gradable deliverable, not just the conclusion.
3. Epistemic hedges (scope limits, dataset/validity caveats) are required content by default, not defensive padding to trim.
4. Fixed report structure, formal register (no contractions, no "the real problem is" style casual confidence), exact benchmark figures, precise regulatory citations, LaTeX conventions (keywords A–Z, `10 mm` spacing) folded in.

Packaged as .skill, delivered to user for install. Any account drafting SPARK/BiasAperture/thesis prose should consult this variant.

## 2026-08-15

- [claude_chat, 2026-08-15T09:32:08Z] BiasAperture (github.com/Aaradhya-Dev-Tamrakar/BiasAperture) — parallelization plan, WBS/schedule per report/src/chapters/systemArchitectureAndMethodology.tex §Work Breakdown Structure + §Project Plan and Schedule (repo's own source of truth, not invented). 2 people (Aaradhya, Tisha) working the actual WBS Stream A/B split; 4+ orch accounts available as compute lanes on top of that, not additional owners.

WP1 — Classifier Selection & Schema Lock (WBS 1.1/1.2, Together, blocking). Fixes classifier baseline + internal schema: image_id, race/gender/age subgroup fields, predicted/true labels; detection-engine output additionally needs metric name, point estimate, CI bounds, p-value, subgroup sample size. Ends M1. Nothing in WP2/WP3 should start against this schema until locked.

WP2 (1.3, Stream A) / WP3 (1.4, Stream B) — parallel from M1.

- Stream A: dataset acquisition + integrity check, inference run, schema curation, stratified dev subset (FairFace primary; UTKFace only if descope budget allows).
- Stream B: HTML/Jinja2 report template, Model Cards/Datasheets structure, hand-written mock metrics dictionary validating against WP1's field set.
Converge M2.

WP4 (1.5, Together) — Statistical Detection Engine. Consumes Stream A's test matrix, produces the schema-shaped metrics dict Stream B's template expects. AIF360 + Fairlearn backends, 4 disparity metrics (demographic parity diff, equalized odds diff, equal opportunity diff, disparate impact ratio), chi-squared test, bootstrap CI, sample-size guard. Ends M3.

WP5 (1.6, Together) — Integration: mock-to-real swap of Stream B's dict, orchestration module.

WP6/WP7 (1.7/1.8, Together) — V&V (runtime targets, report-completeness rule, case-study run) → M4; then scope-boundary statement, final report, submission package.

Compute-lane assignment for the 4+ accounts: 1 acct executing Stream A, 1 acct executing Stream B, 1 acct running continuous schema-conformance check of both streams' output against WP1's locked field list (catch drift before M2, not at integration), 1 acct floating for WP1/WP4/WP5 Together phases or starting docs (1.8) early since scope-boundary statement doesn't depend on stream convergence.

Descoping order if behind schedule (report's own cutlist, in order): 1) web UI, keep CLI only, 2) UTKFace, keep FairFace only, 3) PDF export, keep HTML only, 4) direct in-process inference, keep predictions-file ingestion only, 5) AIF360, keep Fairlearn only (last resort, only cut that weakens cross-validated claim). Non-negotiable core never cut: data ingestion, one model interface, the fairness engine, one report format, the scope-boundary statement.

Status as of push: repo currently contains ONLY the LaTeX proposal report (report/, docs/, vendor/) — no implementation code yet. No orch tasks created for this yet (user said chat-only for now, not stood up as tasks). No other account has touched BiasAperture — first orch mention of this repo. NLM notebooks dd5fe5c6-bb39-4d35-b23b-332fd2b98de4 and 99bee3c6-07ed-4ff0-8ac8-0027b18ad06a (linked this session, neither matches the known 95a79d26 "Engineer's Personal Notebook") were NOT read — nlm auth was stale/expired this session (refresh_auth confirmed stale, needs `nlm login` on user's end), so their content is unverified and not folded into this plan.

## 2026-08-21

- [claude-spark-orchestrator, 2026-08-21T01:50:12Z] Context for anyone claiming a SPARK deep-research track (task_2026-08-21_002 through _020, parent task_2026-08-21_001):

1. NLM auth was stale as of this planning session (refresh_auth returned "stale", not recoverable without `nlm login` on Aaradhya's machine) — the two notebooks he pointed this session at (95a79d26-2f87-42cd-8cb9-8361a1e56059, personal notebook; 2c00f5a4-98dc-4783-96d1-3682fa3cb516, main SPARK notebook) were NOT queried this session. Check auth before assuming they're unreachable for you too.

2. A third relevant notebook exists per task_2026-08-12_003's own spec: 3b67fc33-d1db-4609-9947-cd4e5bdac235 ("secondary SPARK notebook," 45 sources — 4 original + 41 methodology-research sources via deep search). Literature tracks (1/2/3/16 especially) should check this before starting from zero — it may already have relevant sourcing. task_2026-08-12_003 (pending, unclaimed) wants 19 methodology/citation-verification sources deleted from the main 2c00f5a4 notebook since they're now redundant with this secondary one — that cleanup is orthogonal to the research tracks, don't block on it.

3. team-context.md is still the unedited template (checked via read_team_context this session) — no durable cross-profile context is loaded for any account yet. Aaradhya should fill it in; not something an executor task can fix.

4. Repo state this plan was built against: github.com/AaradhyaDT/SPARK main @ 53f194de7cd0679c866d905275b465f80c0d9bfb, tracker v54 (Aug 20 2026). If your clone is behind this, `git pull` before trusting any "already resolved" boundary stated in a track spec.

## 2026-08-22

- [claude-spark-orchestrator, 2026-08-22T06:18:26Z] Correction to my earlier entry (pushed same session) re: NLM notebooks — auth has since been refreshed by Aaradhya, all 3 notebooks now checked directly:

- 3b67fc33-d1db-4609-9947-cd4e5bdac235 ("SPARK Project Tracker: ESP32-S3 Hardware Upgrade and Design Reference") — the 41 methodology-research sources are GONE (Aaradhya deleted them as irrelevant). Now just 4 sources: fig_cnn_architecture.png, SPARK_Presentation_Proposal_Defense deck, SPARK_Proposal_20260701_v37.pdf, SPARK_TRACKER_v8_20260709.md. NOTE: that tracker copy is v8 (2026-07-09) — far behind live repo's v54. Don't treat this notebook as current for anything tracker-related; it's proposal/presentation reference only now.
- 2c00f5a4-98dc-4783-96d1-3682fa3cb516 ("SPARK: Two-Layer Edge AI for Wearable Fall Detection") — 6 real academic/reference sources already loaded, directly useful for several research tracks: (1) "Comparison of low-complexity fall detection algorithms for body attached accelerometers", (2) "Evaluation of a threshold-based tri-axial accelerometer fall detection algorithm" (PubMed), (3) Nepal National Population and Housing Census 2021 population projections, (4) SisFall dataset paper (Semantic Scholar), (5) "TensorFlow Lite Micro: Embedded ML on TinyML Systems" (MLSys Proceedings), (6) WHO Global report on falls prevention in older age. Tracks 5 (TFLite Micro alternatives), 7 (SisFall taxonomy), 8 (elderly-vs-young validity), 16/17 (related work/motivation) should start here before searching cold.
- Track 8 lead: SisFall's own paper source_describe explicitly states detection algorithms trained on young adults often fail to maintain sensitivity/accuracy on elderly populations — directly on-point for the 18-35-cohort-as-elderly-proxy question. Start there.
- 95a79d26-2f87-42cd-8cb9-8361a1e56059 (personal notebook) — confirmed to also mirror SPARK README/TRACKER/CHANGELOG/WIRE_FORMAT via GitHub-source links, plus cross-project sources (BiasAperture, portfolio site, and a Claude-Desktop repo containing team-context.md/team-memory.md as tracked files — i.e. this orchestrator's own state may itself be git-backed at github.com/Aaradhya-Dev-Tamrakar/Claude-Desktop, unconfirmed, no link given to act on this directly).

## 2026-08-22

- [user14, 2026-08-22T08:16:51Z] NLM auth is stale as of 2026-08-22T08:15Z — refresh_auth returns "reason: stale, disk reload cannot revive expired credentials, run `nlm login` in a terminal." Could not query notebook 2c00f5a4 (main SPARK) or 95a79d26 (personal) for Track 14. Proceeded on external web research only, flagged as a limitation in Track 14's checkpoint. Other tracks planning to "check NLM before external research" (user15+ per their live-status notes) may hit the same wall — needs an interactive `nlm login` from Aaradhya's terminal to clear.
- [user15, 2026-08-22T08:20:40Z] task_2026-08-21_016 (Track 15, aquatic/drowning IMU params) — DONE, checkpoint submitted. Repo used: github.com/AaradhyaDT/SPARK (matches team-context/task_2026-08-21_001 authoritative name, not the stale Aaradhya-Dev-Tamrakar one user4 flagged). Clone HEAD 53f194de7cd0679c866d905275b465f80c0d9bfb matches tracker v54 stamped commit — no drift. NLM 2c00f5a4 auth was stale at session start, refresh_auth fixed it in one call. Summary: stroke-cadence 0.4-1.6Hz well-supported by literature; IDR >2.5Hz struggle-index has no traceable source anywhere (Pia's IDR is qualitative-only) — flagged as unvalidated estimate; >15s submersion timeout brackets between real precedents (Poseidon camera systems=10s, one wearable Sensors paper's ~60s window) but isn't itself derived from either. Full detail in checkpoint result_text.
- [user17, 2026-08-22T08:15:31Z] Track 17 (task_2026-08-21_018): NLM auth stale again this session (refresh_auth confirmed stale) — same issue orchestrator flagged then said was fixed 2026-08-22 06:18; may have re-expired since. Could not query 2c00f5a4 to double-check for commercial-product sources before web searching, but per orchestrator's 06:18 entry the 6 sources there are all academic/dataset (SisFall, WHO falls report, TFLite Micro paper, etc.) — no commercial-product content, so proceeding to cold web search was safe/non-duplicative. Flagging for any other account hitting this: nlm needs a fresh `nlm login` from Aaradhya again.
- [user22, 2026-08-22T08:20:13Z] user22 acting as SPARK deep-research orchestrator check-in (2026-08-22). Board status: 17/19 child tracks (task_2026-08-21_002–_020) done. Remaining: Track 15/task_016 (aquatic distress, user15) and Track 16/task_017 (related-work synthesis, user16), both still 'claimed' (in progress, not blocked). No action needed yet — will re-check before running merge_results. Also flagging for the record: the task-assignment doc handed to this account named the repo as Aaradhya-Dev-Tamrakar/SPARK and a nonexistent user22 track — same stale-repo-name issue user4 already flagged. No repo was cloned under that wrong name.
- [user4, 2026-08-22T08:12:41Z] task_2026-08-21_005 (Track 4, sensitivity-boosting literature) — DONE, checkpoint submitted. Flag for other track-claiming accounts: the task-assignment doc some of us are being handed names the repo as github.com/Aaradhya-Dev-Tamrakar/SPARK — that's stale/wrong. Authoritative per read_team_context + task_2026-08-21_001 is github.com/AaradhyaDT/SPARK @ 53f194de7cd0679c866d905275b465f80c0d9bfb (tracker v54). Cloned the AaradhyaDT one, matched the stamped commit exactly, no issue — just don't clone the Aaradhya-Dev-Tamrakar name if you see it in your own task doc.

## 2026-08-22

- [user5, 2026-08-22T13:24:14Z] Standing workflow instructions (repo gate, sync.ps1 protocol, file delivery, output constraints, nlm notebooks):

**Instructions**
Verify before responding —

1. Recommend a model + effort level + whether extended thinking is needed for this prompt, so it can be switched manually if needed.
2. Before any clone/pull/git tool call: state one line — `repo link/path given this turn: yes` or `repo link/path given this turn: no`. This line is mandatory and not skippable, and must be stated before the tool call, not after. If "no" and no repo has been cloned/pulled yet this session, do not clone or pull — ask which repo rather than assuming. If "no" but a repo was already cloned/pulled earlier in this session, treat a clear pull/sync request ("pull the repo," "check latest," "sync it") as referring to that repo and `git pull` it — state which repo you're assuming. If "yes" and already cloned this session, `git pull` instead of re-cloning.

Diff any new/uploaded content against live repo state (title/search-index diffs, id↔href integrity, syntax, tag balance) before delivering; discover actual repo conventions via inspection, never assume. Be maximally concise — no preamble, no filler. Dive straight to work. Follow the best practices related to the work being done.

When Claude_export md files are present, read them first then continue the work from previous session.

**Abbreviations**

1. nlm — Notebook LM, also relates to the MCP.
2. orch — orchestrator MCP for Claude Desktop.

**Personal details context (nlm):**

- Personal: ⚙️ Aaradhya — Engineer's Personal Notebook | id `95a79d26-2f87-42cd-8cb9-8361a1e56059`
- SPARK: <https://notebook.google.com/notebook/2c00f5a4-98dc-4783-96d1-3682fa3cb516>
- BiasAperture: <https://notebook.google.com/notebook/99bee3c6-07ed-4ff0-8ac8-0027b18ad06a>

Clone GitHub links added as prompt rather than fetching, as fetching generally returns error.

**sync.ps1 check — mandatory, self-reporting gate:**
Any time a repo is cloned or pulled this session, explicitly state one line: `sync.ps1: found` or `sync.ps1: not found`. This line is not optional and is not skippable.

- If not found (or no repo touched this turn): skip the sync.ps1 workflow entirely, commit normally with a plain commit message.
- If found: the workflow below is mandatory for every edit in that repo for the rest of the session — no plain `git commit`, no exceptions, no silent reversion.

### Local Git Workflow & Auto-Sync (`sync.ps1`)

To prevent merge conflicts on `assets/js/last-commit.json` (updated automatically by a commit-back bot on every push):

- **Minor / Routine Changes:** `.\sync.ps1`
- **Major Features / Architectural Changes** — update `dev-logs/PortfolioWebsite_TRACKER.md` first, then: `.\sync.ps1 -m "feat(scope): detailed architectural summary"`
- **Safe Pull Only:** `.\sync.ps1 -PullOnly`

For `.ipynb` notebooks, do not execute them — run manually in Google Colab or locally.

**File delivery**

- Individual file edits, however small: save to outputs directory, deliver as a file — never inline.
- Whole repo or multi-file reorg: zip preserving repo-relative paths, deliver as a file.

**Output constraints (strict)**

1. Output only the modified/updated content, edits, or targeted change.
2. No conversational framing, lead-ins, or post-explanations.
3. No commentary on what changed or why, unless asked — except: flag regressions/conflicts found during verification in one line, and one-line reasoning notes when a decision needed disambiguation.
4. Verification (diff, syntax/balance checks, cross-ref greps) shown inline as part of the work, not narrated. If a check fails, halt and flag before delivering.
5. Every edit ends with: commit message, and — only if the sync.ps1 gate above is active — the bare `.\sync.ps1 -m "..."` command in the same block. No `cd`, no other preamble.
6. That block is the last thing in the response — no summary, no sign-off after.

**General principle:** What you explicitly command is what gets done. Anything not explicitly instructed — repo choice, scope, ambiguous formatting calls — gets asked about first.

## 2026-08-22

- [user1, 2026-08-22T17:45:02Z] BiasAperture 20-track research board (task_2026-08-22_002): constraint — no git commit/push to the repo from any of the 20 users until all 20 child tracks (task_2026-08-22_003..022) are done. Each user works in their local clone, saves output to research/results/XX_*.md, and holds it uncommitted. Single consolidated commit/push happens only after the full board is done, to avoid mid-sprint drift on the shared CONTEXT.md ground truth.
- [user1, 2026-08-22T17:45:24Z] BiasAperture 20-track research board (parent task_2026-08-22_002): NO commit/push to the repo from any of the 20 users until all 20 child tracks are submitted/done. Work locally, save results to research/results/ locally, hold. Aaradhya will do a single consolidated commit after merge_results — avoids 20 uncoordinated pushes and mid-sprint drift on research/CONTEXT.md.
- [user1, 2026-08-22T17:46:25Z] BiasAperture 20-track research board (parent task_2026-08-22_002) — correction: no repo write access needed for any of the 20 users, and no git push at all. Handoff is via submit_checkpoint(result_text=<markdown output>) only. Aaradhya does the single consolidated commit himself after merge_results. Supersedes prior note about "save locally and hold."

- [user1, 2026-08-23T01:52:13Z] BiasAperture 20-track research board (parent task_2026-08-22_002) — account mapping correction: user1 is the ORCHESTRATOR (Aaradhya), not a research seat. The 20 research accounts are user2..user21, mapped to Track 01..20 respectively (offset by +1 from the original table). Track 01 (task_2026-08-22_003) released back to pending for user2 to claim. Orchestrator (user1) role: dispatch prompts, monitor via list_tasks/read_all_live_status, run merge_results once all 20 are done, do the single consolidated commit. Does not claim/submit_checkpoint on any track itself.

- [user1, 2026-08-23T02:50:32Z] Streams A–F synthesis + master cross-track conflict log (21 discrepancies, 5 blocking) completed for task_2026-08-22_002, after hitting the message limit mid-sprint and resuming. Source data was recovered from session paste after merge_results had already consumed the 20 raw checkpoints (merge_results is single-consumption — once pulled, checkpoint text isn't returned again). Noting for continuity: capture raw track content to durable storage (repo push or local file) at/before merge time in future sprints, since neither the orchestrator nor a fresh container retains it afterward.

- [Aaradhya, 2026-09-02T10:17:49Z] Track 21 (Continuous/Streaming Audit Mode, task_2026-09-02_003, parent task_2026-09-02_002 Phase-2 sprint) — DONE, checkpoint submitted. Recommendation: two-layer design — Layer 1 = existing one-shot weekly audit unchanged (Fairlearn+AIF360, χ² α=0.05, bootstrap B≥1000, n≥30 guard); Layer 2 = CUSUM control chart over per-window Core-Four point estimates for trend/drift detection. Rejected per-record sequential testing (violates n≥30, Type-I inflation under naive continuous monitoring) and FairCanary's QDD metric (would add a 5th non-Core-Four metric, breaking M1 lock). New additive-only `DriftObservation` dataclass proposed — references MetricResult by value, does NOT modify the locked schema. Two-tier alerting: Watch (CUSUM alone) vs Alarm (CUSUM + fresh within-window χ² significance, dual-gate). Formal Lan-DeMets alpha-spending flagged as optional separate follow-on, not required for v1. Full deliverable: research/results/21_streaming_audit_mode.md. Relevant to any other Stream G/H/I track touching MetricResult or the report/alerting layer — flag here rather than re-deriving.
- [user10, 2026-09-02T10:17:44Z] BiasAperture Phase-2, Track 29 (task_2026-09-02_011, Pluggable Fairness-Metric Registry, Stream I) — DONE, checkpoint submitted. Verdict: PROTOTYPE FIRST, novelty Moderate, scope CORE EXTENSION. Design: additive fairness/registry.py (MetricSpec: compute_fn/transform[difference|ratio]/fair_point/value_range/eligibility) + new ExtendedMetricResult (metric_name: str, shares NFR-003 guard via extracted helper) — schema.py's locked Literal untouched. Key finding for other tracks: fairness/statistics.py's bootstrap-CI + chi-squared are already metric-agnostic; only eligible_groups() (base.py), the DIR-tolerance branch (backends.py), and the hardcoded [0,1] CI clip (must become declared value_range) need generalizing. Coordination flags raised: Track 26 owns the new "Extended Metrics" report section (not designed here); Track 31/32 should reserve a metric-selection field in their profile/API schemas; Track 36 — plugin metrics must render regulatory-unmapped, never inherit Core Four's EU AI Act tags. Orthogonal to (dropped) Track 23 — MetricSpec has no dependency on FairFace-specific demographic semantics. Full report: results/29_pluggable_metric_registry.md (delivered as file, not committed to repo — research-only task, no repo edits made).
- [user11, 2026-09-02T10:18:32Z] Track 24 (task_2026-09-02_006, Bias Root-Cause Clustering) done — result in checkpoint result_text. Two coordination flags for other tracks:

1. → Track 25/26 owner (Web Dashboard / Drill-Down Report UX): reserve a UI slot for a future "Shared Drivers / Root Cause Themes" section when finalizing the 3-tier drill-down structure — don't lock the layout without it, retrofitting later is harder. Not required now (Track 24's own recommendation is PROTOTYPE FIRST on a lightweight variant only), just don't design it out.

2. Track 24 effectively re-opens Phase-1 Track 16 (Proxy Variable Detection via SHAP, research/results/stream_d_explainability.md) — that pipeline (DeepSHAP + face-parsing segmentation → per-region SHAP-mass vectors) was scoped but never implemented; 6 open items still logged unresolved there. Track 24's "cluster attribution vectors" ask depends on Track 16 existing first. Recommend Aaradhya/Tisha jointly decide whether to revive Track 16 before any Phase-2 track builds further explainability features on top of it.

Also flagging a pre-existing gap unrelated to clustering itself: explainability.py's ExplanationResult output has zero integration into report/generator.py today (verified via grep) — only reachable via `cli.py --explain` stdout. Any future explainability-facing report section (Track 24, 26, or otherwise) needs this wiring built regardless of which feature lands first.

Full report: results/24_bias_rootcause_clustering.md (suggested path, not yet written to repo — research-only per task spec).

- [20, 2026-09-02T10:40:53Z] BiasAperture Phase-2, Track 30 (task_2026-09-02_012, Model-Agnostic Classifier Adapter Layer, Stream I) — DONE, checkpoint submitted. Verdict: PROTOTYPE FIRST, novelty Low-Moderate, scope CORE EXTENSION (InProcessInterface). Design: shared TaxonomyMapper (config-driven mapping from a third-party model's native output labels to the locked race_7/gender_2/age_9 Literal, fail-fast construction-time validation, sum-based probability collapse for many-to-one mappings) consumed by two thin adapters: ONNXRuntimeAdapter (format-agnostic, integrator supplies preprocessing + positional label order — highest effort, silent-reorder risk) and HFPipelineAdapter (AutoModelForImageClassification only, built-in preprocessing, string id2label labels — lower effort, safer mapping authoring). Recommend prototyping HF adapter first to validate the InProcessInterface+TaxonomyMapper contract end-to-end, then ONNX for real client models. Out of scope: models with structurally incompatible native demographic taxonomies — not adapter-solvable, needs Track 23. Coordination flag for board owner: Track 23 is marked "(dropped)" in Track 29's memory entry, but this task's own spec still names Track 23 as the explicit prerequisite for the out-of-scope case — discrepancy surfaced, not resolved here. Full report: results/30_model_agnostic_adapters.md (delivered as file, not committed to repo — research-only task, no repo edits made).
- [Aaradhya, 2026-09-02T10:43:13Z] BiasAperture Phase-2 orchestrator board (parent task_2026-09-02_002) — account-naming inconsistency: several executors claimed/submitted tasks under bare-number account names instead of the "userN" convention used elsewhere on this board. Specifically: Track 26 (task_2026-09-02_008) done under account "24"; Track 30 (task_2026-09-02_012) done under account "20"; Track 32 (task_2026-09-02_014) done under account "24"; Track 37 (task_2026-09-02_019) claimed (not yet done) under account "23". No orchestrator tool exists to rename/relabel owner_account on a task after claim_task or submit_checkpoint has been called — release_task + re-claim under the correct name is the only in-band fix, and that requires the original claiming account to act (an orchestrator/different account can't do it on their behalf). For the 3 already-done tasks (26/30/32), there is currently no way to relabel provenance at all short of a manual edit to the underlying task store. Flagging this as a known, currently-unresolved provenance inconsistency on this board for anyone doing the eventual merge_results/synthesis pass.
- [user25, 2026-09-02T10:43:38Z] Track 31 (task_2026-09-02_013, Config-Driven Audit-as-Code Profiles, Stream I) — DONE, checkpoint submitted. Verdict: PROTOTYPE FIRST, novelty Low-Moderate, scope ADDITIVE (new config layer in front of cli.py flags, no changes to fairness/statistics.py, schema.py's locked Literal, or base.py). Schema: profile_id/extends/regulatory_mapping/metrics(core+extended+active)/subgroups/statistics(alpha, bootstrap_resamples, n_min_guard)/drift_monitoring/overrides[]/ci_cd. Loosening NFR-001(alpha)/NFR-002(bootstrap floor)/NFR-003(n>=30) requires an overrides[] entry (justification+approved_by) plus an auto-stamped append-only audit log line; tightening never needs approval. Validation split into a structural pass + NFR-gate pass, both in one profile_validator.py module usable by cli.py at run-time and Track 32's CI at commit-time — single source of truth. Coordination: Track 29's `metrics.active` selection field is implemented as asked; Track 36's rule enforced at validator level (metrics.extended/plugin entries always render regulatory-unmapped regardless of the profile's top-level regulatory_mapping); drift_monitoring block is optional and orthogonal to Track 21's Layer-2 CUSUM — Track 26 should know extended/plugin metrics need their own unmapped presentation, not folded into the Core Four table. Open items for whoever owns the NFR docs: exact schema.py Core Four enum names, NFR-001's bound direction and NFR-002's exact floor (only current operating defaults α=0.05/B≥1000 were available via team memory, not the source NFR text), and whether an NFR-003 override should still respect a hard absolute floor. Full report: results/31_audit_as_code_profiles.md (delivered as file, not committed to repo — research-only task, no repo edits made).
